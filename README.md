# obscurx-browser
A Browser UI that is using Brave search engine

- First of all, I do OWN the UI. I wanted to make something like Kando running on a web browser.

It's controls are easy. Just like a normal brwoser. But this browser has it's own Right click UI. If you right click the shortcuts you added, you can delete them.
