# Fafnir Search

Fafnir Search is a fork of the ObscurX search UI, redesigned with a Nord-themed color palette and additional enhancements.

## Features

- **Nord Theme**: The UI has been adjusted to fit the Nord color scheme, providing a cool and minimalistic appearance.
- **Live Clock**: A 24-hour format clock is displayed at the top center of the page.
- **Search History**: A history button in the top left corner allows users to toggle their search history.
- **Animated Search Bar**: The search bar retains the original animations from ObscurX, modified to be smoother.
- **Change Search Engines**: Users can switch between different search engines.

   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Start searching!

## Customization
